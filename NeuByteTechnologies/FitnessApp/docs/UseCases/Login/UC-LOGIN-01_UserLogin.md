(BR‑Login‑08)
10. 	System stores the session token in an HTTP‑only cookie.
(BR‑Login‑09)
11. 	System redirects the user to the Dashboard.
(BR‑Login‑07)

## Non‑Functional Requirements
• 	Security: All credentials must be transmitted over HTTPS. (BR‑Login‑15)
• 	Performance: Authentication must complete quickly.
• 	Accessibility: Login form must support keyboard navigation and screen readers. (SRS‑A11Y‑01)
