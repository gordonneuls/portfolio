# Help & Support — Use Case Overview
The Help module contains use cases related to displaying support content, FAQs, policies, and contact options within the application. These use cases define how users access self‑service help resources, view static informational content, and initiate support interactions.
This module supports the user’s ability to resolve issues independently and understand the application’s policies and support channels.
