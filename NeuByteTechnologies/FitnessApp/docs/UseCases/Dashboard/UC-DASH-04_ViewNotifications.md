## Purpose
To allow an authenticated user to view system‑generated notifications from the Dashboard, ensuring they can quickly access unread alerts, review notification details, and maintain awareness of important activity or system events.

## Primary Actor
Authenticated User
## Stakeholders & Interests
- 	User — wants to easily see unread notifications and review important updates.
- 	System — must retrieve accurate notification data and maintain read/unread status.
- 	Product Owner — wants a clean, intuitive notification experience accessible from all authenticated pages.
- 	Security Team — requires that users only see their own notifications.
- 	Analytics Team — needs to track notification views and interactions.

## Preconditions
- 	User is authenticated.
- 	User is on the Dashboard or any authenticated page.
- 	Notification data exists (or fallback messaging is available).
- 	System can retrieve notifications from the data store.

## Postconditions
Success
- 	User views the list of notifications.
- 	Notification read/unread status is updated appropriately.
Failure
- 	User remains on the Dashboard.
- 	System displays an error message if notifications cannot be retrieved.

## Trigger
User selects the Notification Icon or Notification Count from the Dashboard header.

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. 	User selects the Notification icon or unread count.
(BR‑N‑02)
2. 	System verifies that the user is authenticated.
(BR‑DASH‑22)
3. 	System retrieves all notifications for the user (read + unread).
(BR‑N‑03, BR‑N‑06)
4. 	System displays the Notification List page or panel.
(BR‑N‑03)
5. 	System displays each notification with:
- 	Message text
- 	Timestamp
- 	Read/unread indicator
(BR‑N‑03)
6. 	User selects a notification to expand or view details.
(BR‑N‑04)
7. 	System marks the notification as read.
(BR‑N‑04, BR‑N‑05)
8. 	System updates the unread notification count.
(BR‑N‑02)
9. 	System logs the notification view event for analytics.
(BR‑DASH‑23)

## Alternate Flows
A1 — No Notifications Available
- 	Step 3 returns zero results.
- 	System displays an empty state message.
(BR‑N‑03 fallback)
A2 — User Views Notification but Does Not Expand
- 	Steps 1–5 occur.
- 	User closes the panel without selecting a notification.
- 	No read/unread changes occur.

## Exception Flows
E1 — Authentication Failure
- 	Step 2 fails.
- 	System redirects user to Login page.
(BR‑DASH‑22)
E2 — Notification Retrieval Error
- 	Step 3 fails due to system/database issue.
- 	System displays an error message.
(BR‑N‑06)
- 	User remains on the Dashboard.

## Non‑Functional Requirements
- 	Security: Users may only view their own notifications. (BR‑N‑06)
- 	Performance: Notification list must load quickly.
- 	Responsive UI: Notification panel/list must render correctly on all device sizes. (BR‑DASH‑14)
- 	Accessibility: Notification icon, list, and items must support keyboard navigation and screen readers. (SRS‑A11Y‑01)
- 	Analytics: Notification view events must be logged. (BR‑DASH‑23)
