# Dashboard — Use Case Overview
The Dashboard module contains use cases that define how authenticated users view, interact with, and navigate from the main landing page of the application. These use cases describe how the system retrieves, displays, and updates personalized fitness data, recent activity, notifications, and quick‑action workflows.
The Dashboard serves as the central hub for the user experience and integrates with multiple subsystems including workouts, programs, weight tracking, and notifications.
