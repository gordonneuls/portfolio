# Log Workout — Use Case Overview
The Log Workout module contains use cases that define how users execute, record, modify, and manage their daily workout activity. These use cases describe the full interaction model for logging exercises, editing historical entries, copying previous workouts, and expanding grouped exercises.
This module represents one of the core functional areas of the application and integrates with programs, exercises, history, validation rules, and accessibility requirements.

## Table of Contents
Use Cases
• 	UC‑LW‑01 — Log Workout
Allows users to record sets, reps, weight, duration, and other exercise metrics for the current day’s workout.
• 	UC‑LW‑02 — Edit Log
Enables users to modify previously logged workout entries, including sets, reps, weight, and notes.
• 	UC‑LW‑03 — View History
Allows users to view historical workout logs by date, including completed exercises and recorded metrics.
• 	UC‑LW‑04 — Delete Log
Allows users to remove a previously logged workout entry with confirmation and validation.
• 	UC‑LW‑05 — Copy Previous
Enables users to copy exercise data from a previous workout to streamline logging and reduce repetitive data entry.
• 	UC‑LW‑06 — Expand Groups
Allows users to expand grouped exercises (e.g., supersets, circuits) to view and log each exercise individually.
(Additional Log Workout UCs may be added as the module expands — e.g., Auto‑Save Workout, Timer/Rest Tracking, Exercise Substitution, or Offline Logging.)
