# Performance & Caching Module  
Cross‑Module Performance Framework & System‑Wide Optimization Behaviors

The **Performance & Caching module** defines all cross‑cutting behaviors the NeuByte Fitness application uses to ensure fast, efficient, and responsive performance across all modules. These behaviors apply to *every* feature area — Dashboard, Programs, Weight Tracking, Reports, Help, Notifications, and more.

Performance ensures:
- Fast load times  
- Efficient API usage  
- Smooth UI rendering  
- Optimized caching and preloading  
- Reduced network overhead  
- Predictable performance across devices  
- Consistent user experience

## 📌 Purpose of the Performance & Caching Module
The Performance module captures system‑wide optimization behaviors that appear across multiple modules but must be defined once at the architectural level.

This includes:
- Data caching  
- Preloading  
- Lazy loading  
- Request batching  
- Debounce/throttle logic  
- Skeleton loading  
- Image optimization  
- Slow network handling  
- Rendering optimization  
- Performance analytics  

These behaviors are referenced by many modules but are not owned by any single one.

## 🚀 Performance & Caching Use Cases (UC‑PERF‑01 → UC‑PERF‑10)

### **UC‑PERF‑01 — Cache Frequently Accessed Data**
Caches high‑frequency data (dashboard, program list, weight entries) to improve performance.  
Includes cache read/write, invalidation, and expiration rules.

### **UC‑PERF‑02 — Preload Critical Data**
Preloads essential data during navigation to reduce perceived load time.  
Includes dashboard data, program metadata, and user profile.

### **UC‑PERF‑03 — Lazy Load Non‑Critical Content**
Defers loading of non‑essential UI elements to improve initial render speed.  
Includes images, workout history, and notifications.

### **UC‑PERF‑04 — Optimize API Request Batching**
Reduces network overhead by batching related API calls.  
Includes combined requests and shared response parsing.

### **UC‑PERF‑05 — Debounce & Throttle User Input**
Prevents excessive API calls from rapid user interactions.  
Includes search debounce, button throttling, and scroll throttling.

### **UC‑PERF‑06 — Use Skeleton & Placeholder Loading States**
Improves perceived performance with skeleton screens and placeholders.  
Includes skeleton cards, placeholder text, and progressive loading.

### **UC‑PERF‑07 — Optimize Image & Media Loading**
Ensures images and media load efficiently across devices.  
Includes responsive sizes, compression, lazy loading, and caching.

### **UC‑PERF‑08 — Detect & Handle Slow Network Conditions**
Adjusts behavior when network speed is low.  
Includes reduced data mode, lower‑resolution images, and warning banners.

### **UC‑PERF‑09 — Optimize Client‑Side Rendering**
Ensures UI renders efficiently on all supported devices.  
Includes efficient DOM updates, memoization, and avoiding unnecessary re‑renders.

### **UC‑PERF‑10 — Monitor & Log Performance Metrics**
Tracks performance metrics across modules for analytics and optimization.  
Includes page load time, API latency, cache hit/miss, and rendering time.

## 🧩 Architectural Role
The Performance & Caching module provides the **system‑wide optimization framework** used by all feature modules. It defines:

- **Caching strategy**  
- **Preloading strategy**  
- **Lazy loading rules**  
- **Request batching patterns**  
- **Debounce/throttle rules**  
- **Skeleton loading patterns**  
- **Image optimization rules**  
- **Slow network behavior**  
- **Rendering optimization**  
- **Performance analytics**  

This ensures that each module can focus on business logic while relying on a consistent, efficient performance foundation.

## 🧪 Testing Considerations
Performance requires cross‑module test coverage:

- Cache hit/miss behavior  
- Preloading correctness  
- Lazy loading behavior  
- Request batching  
- Debounce/throttle correctness  
- Skeleton loading rendering  
- Image optimization  
- Slow network simulation  
- Rendering performance  
- Performance analytics logging  

These tests are executed across multiple modules but trace back to **Performance UCs**.
