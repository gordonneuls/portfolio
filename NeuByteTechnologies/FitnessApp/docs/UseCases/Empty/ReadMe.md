# Empty State Module  
Cross‑Module Empty State Framework & Zero‑Data Behaviors

The **Empty State module** defines all system‑wide behaviors the NeuByte Fitness application uses when a feature has *no data to display*. These states are not errors — they occur when the system is functioning correctly, but the user has not yet generated data.

Empty states ensure:
- Clear, friendly guidance for first‑time users  
- Consistent messaging across modules  
- Predictable fallback UI  
- No broken layouts or confusing blank screens  
- A smooth onboarding experience

## 📌 Purpose of the Empty State Module
The Empty State module captures all cross‑module “zero data” behaviors that appear in multiple modules but must be defined once at the architectural level.

This includes:
- No notifications  
- No weight entries  
- No program selected  
- No workout history  
- Insufficient data for trends  
- No progress metrics  

These states appear across Dashboard, Notifications, Weight Tracking, Programs, and Reports — but are not owned by any single module.

## 🟦 Empty State Use Cases (UC‑EMPTY‑01 → UC‑EMPTY‑06)

### **UC‑EMPTY‑01 — No Notifications**
Triggered when the notification list is empty.  
Displays: “You have no notifications yet.”

### **UC‑EMPTY‑02 — No Weight Entries**
Triggered when the user has never logged weight.  
Displays: “Add your first weight entry to begin tracking.”

### **UC‑EMPTY‑03 — No Program Selected**
Triggered when the user has not chosen an exercise program.  
Displays: “Select a program to get started.”

### **UC‑EMPTY‑04 — No Workout History**
Triggered when the user has never logged a workout.  
Displays: “No workouts logged yet.”

### **UC‑EMPTY‑05 — Insufficient Data for Trends**
Triggered when weight or workout data is too sparse to calculate trends.  
Displays: “Not enough data to calculate trends.”

### **UC‑EMPTY‑06 — No Progress Metrics**
Triggered when streaks, weekly summaries, or monthly summaries have no data.  
Displays: “Progress metrics will appear once you start logging activity.”

## 🧩 Architectural Role
The Empty State module provides the **system‑wide zero‑data framework** used by all feature modules. It defines:

- **When empty states trigger**  
- **What message is shown**  
- **How the UI behaves**  
- **How empty states differ from errors**  
- **How empty states integrate with module UCs**  

This ensures that each module can focus on business logic while relying on a consistent, user‑friendly empty state experience.

## 🔗 Dependencies & Cross‑Module Relationships

### **Modules that depend on Empty States**
- Dashboard  
- Notifications  
- Weight Tracking  
- Exercise Program  
- Reports  
- Global module  
- Performance module (lazy loading + skeletons)  
- Error Handling module (fallback vs. error distinction)  

### **Shared UI Specs**
- `UIS-EMPTY-NOTIFICATIONS-01`  
- `UIS-EMPTY-WEIGHT-01`  
- `UIS-EMPTY-PROGRAM-01`  
- `UIS-EMPTY-WORKOUTS-01`  
- `UIS-EMPTY-TRENDS-01`  
- `UIS-EMPTY-PROGRESS-01`  

### **Shared System Requirements**
- `SRS-UX-EMPTY-01 Empty State Messaging`  
- `SRS-UX-EMPTY-02 Zero Data Handling`  
- `SRS-UX-EMPTY-03 First-Time User Experience`

## 🧪 Testing Considerations
Empty State testing requires cross‑module validation:

- No notifications  
- No weight entries  
- No program selected  
- No workout history  
- Insufficient data for trends  
- No progress metrics  
- Correct messaging  
- Correct fallback UI  
- No overlap with error states  
- No broken layouts  

These tests are executed across multiple modules but trace back to **Empty State UCs**.
