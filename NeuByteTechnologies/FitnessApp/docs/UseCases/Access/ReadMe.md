# Accessibility Module  
Cross‑Module Accessibility Framework & WCAG Compliance Behaviors

The **Accessibility module** defines all cross‑cutting accessibility behaviors required to ensure the NeuByte Fitness application is usable by all users, including those relying on assistive technologies. These behaviors apply across *every* module — Dashboard, Login, Programs, Weight Tracking, Reports, Help, Notifications, and more.

Accessibility ensures:
- Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards  
- Predictable, inclusive user experience  
- Consistent keyboard and screen reader support  
- Clear focus management and navigation  
- Reduced duplication of accessibility logic across modules  

---

## 📌 Purpose of the Accessibility Module
The Accessibility module captures system‑wide accessibility behaviors that appear in multiple modules but must be defined once at the architectural level.

This includes:
- Keyboard navigation  
- Screen reader support  
- Focus management  
- Color contrast  
- Text resizing  
- Accessible forms  
- Accessible error messaging  
- Accessible interactive components  
- Reduced motion preferences  
- Accessible media and images  

These behaviors are referenced by many modules but are not owned by any single one.

## ♿ Accessibility Use Cases (UC‑A11Y‑01 → UC‑A11Y‑10)

### **UC‑A11Y‑01 — Keyboard‑Only Navigation**
Ensures all interactive elements across all modules are fully operable using keyboard only.  
Includes tab order, focus states, skip‑to‑content, and keyboard shortcuts.

### **UC‑A11Y‑02 — Screen Reader Support**
Ensures all UI elements expose correct semantic labels and roles to screen readers.  
Includes ARIA labels, announcements, live regions, and hidden contextual text.

### **UC‑A11Y‑03 — Focus Management**
Ensures focus is placed correctly after navigation, modal open/close, errors, and dynamic updates.  
Includes focus trapping, focus return, and focus on error.

### **UC‑A11Y‑04 — Color Contrast Compliance**
Ensures all text, icons, and UI elements meet WCAG contrast ratios.  
Includes light/dark mode, disabled states, and hover/focus states.

### **UC‑A11Y‑05 — Text Resizing & Zoom Support**
Ensures UI remains usable when users zoom or increase text size.  
Includes 200% zoom, responsive reflow, and no clipped text.

### **UC‑A11Y‑06 — Accessible Forms**
Ensures all forms across modules are accessible.  
Includes labels, error messages, instructions, required indicators, and grouping.

### **UC‑A11Y‑07 — Accessible Error Messaging**
Ensures error messages are announced and visible to assistive technologies.  
Includes ARIA‑live regions, focus on error, and descriptive messaging.

### **UC‑A11Y‑08 — Accessible Interactive Components**
Ensures all buttons, toggles, menus, tabs, and cards meet accessibility rules.  
Includes roles, states, keyboard behavior, and ARIA attributes.

### **UC‑A11Y‑09 — Motion & Animation Preferences**
Respects user system settings for reduced motion.  
Includes disabling animations, reducing transitions, and providing alternatives.

### **UC‑A11Y‑10 — Accessible Media & Images**
Ensures all images, icons, and media have accessible alternatives.  
Includes alt text, descriptions, captions, and transcripts.

## 🧩 Architectural Role
The Accessibility module provides the **system‑wide accessibility framework** used by all feature modules. It defines:

- **Keyboard navigation rules**  
- **Screen reader semantics**  
- **Focus management patterns**  
- **Contrast and color rules**  
- **Accessible form patterns**  
- **Accessible error surfaces**  
- **Motion preference handling**  
- **Media accessibility requirements**  

This ensures that each module can focus on business logic while relying on a consistent, inclusive accessibility foundation.

## 🧪 Testing Considerations
Accessibility requires cross‑module test coverage:

- Keyboard‑only navigation  
- Screen reader announcements  
- Focus placement and trapping  
- Contrast validation  
- Zoom and text resizing  
- Form accessibility  
- Error message accessibility  
- Interactive component accessibility  
- Reduced motion behavior  
- Alt text and media accessibility  

These tests are executed across multiple modules but trace back to **Accessibility UCs**.
