# Notifications — Use Case Overview
The Notifications module contains use cases related to receiving, viewing, managing, and interacting with system‑generated alerts. These use cases define how users access their notifications, understand unread activity, open detailed messages, and manage their notification lifecycle.
This module provides the global alerting framework that supports all other modules by surfacing important events, updates, and system actions.

## Table of Contents
Use Cases
• UC‑NOTE‑01 — View Notifications
