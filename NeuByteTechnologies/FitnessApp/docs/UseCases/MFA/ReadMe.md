# Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA) — Use Case Overview
The MFA module contains use cases related to verifying a user’s identity using a second authentication factor after successful primary login. These use cases define how users enter MFA codes, how the system validates them, and how MFA integrates with the overall authentication flow.
This module supports the security requirements of the authentication subsystem and is referenced by the Login Flow module.

## Table of Contents
Use Cases
• 	UC‑LOGIN‑MFA‑01 — Multi‑Factor Authentication
Handles MFA verification after successful credential authentication, including TOTP code entry, validation, error handling, and redirect to the Dashboard.
(Additional MFA UCs may be added as the module expands — e.g., MFA Recovery, MFA Reset, MFA Device Management.)

## Purpose of This Module
The MFA module provides:
• 	A clear definition of MFA verification behavior
• 	A foundation for higher‑level flows such as:
• 	Login Sequence
• 	MFA Enrollment Sequence
• 	Account Recovery
• 	A traceability anchor for BR‑LOGIN‑MFA‑01 → BR‑LOGIN‑MFA‑07 and related functional/UI specifications
• 	A clean separation between MFA verification, MFA enrollment, and authentication flows
This module is essential for:
• 	Security reviews
• 	QA test planning
• 	Architecture validation
• 	Portfolio reviewers evaluating your system’s security maturity

## Relationship to Other Modules
The MFA module interacts with:
## Login Module
• 	MFA verification occurs immediately after credential authentication
• 	MFA failures return the user to the Login flow
## LoginFlow Module
• 	UC‑LOGIN‑FLOW‑01 Login Sequence references MFA verification
• 	UC‑LOGIN‑FLOW‑03 MFA Enrollment Sequence handles first‑time setup
## Security Subsystems
• 	TOTP generation and validation
• 	Token expiration and retry limits
• 	Logging and analytics for MFA attempts
## Dashboard Module
• 	Successful MFA redirects to the Dashboard
