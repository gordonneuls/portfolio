# Reset Password — Use Case Overview
The Reset Password module contains use cases related to requesting, validating, and completing a secure password reset. These use cases define how users initiate a reset, receive a tokenized link, validate that token, create a new password, and receive confirmation or failure messaging.
This module provides the account recovery framework that ensures users can regain access securely and reliably while maintaining strong security and audit controls.

## Table of Contents
Use Cases
• UC‑RP‑01 — Request Reset
Allows the user to request a password reset by entering their email address.
• UC‑RP‑02 — Validate Reset Token
Validates the reset token from the email link and determines whether the user may proceed.
• UC‑RP‑03 — Reset Password
Allows the user to enter and confirm a new password after token validation.
• UC‑RP‑04 — Reset Success
Displays confirmation that the password has been successfully updated.
• UC‑RP‑05 — Reset Failure
Handles all failure conditions such as expired tokens, invalid tokens, or system errors.
(Additional Reset Password UCs may be added as the module expands — e.g., Multi‑Factor Reset, Password Reset via SMS, Password Reset Rate Limiting.)

## Purpose of This Module
The Reset Password module provides:
• A secure, token‑based password reset workflow
• A clear definition of how users recover access to their accounts
• Strong validation and error‑handling patterns
• A foundation for future enhancements such as:
• Multi‑factor verification
• Device‑based reset flows
• Password strength scoring
• Reset attempt rate limiting
• A traceability anchor for BR‑RP‑01 → BR‑RP‑20 and related functional/UI specifications
• A clean separation between token generation, token validation, password update, and user messaging
This module is essential for maintaining account security and user trust.
